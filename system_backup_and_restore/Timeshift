Use Timeshift to backup and restore system files and settings, whereas user files are not touched
https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift

In Ubuntu 16, select include hidden files to have user settings (e.g. bashrc) in the backup file
In Ubuntu 14, if necessary, may include root folder and home folder, but make sure to keep /home/username/*** folder not included in the backup list to maintain user settings and files (e.g. bashrc, Desktop, Documents). 

Can restore with LiveCD by installing Timeshift into the LiveCD system
